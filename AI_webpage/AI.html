          Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human 
          intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. 
          Specific applications of AI include expert systems, 
          natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.
          It has already become clear that many of the tasks underlying AI can be
          phrased in terms of a search for the solution to the problem at hand.
          Many goal based agents are essentially problem solving agents which must
          decide what to do by searching for a sequence of actions that lead to their
          solutions.
          For production systems, we have seen the need to search for a sequence of rule
          applications that lead to the required fact or action.
          For neural network systems, we need to search for the set of connection
          weights that will result in the required input to output mapping.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="carousel-item">
        <img src="slider2.jpg" class="d-block w-100" style="height: 530px; width: 100%" alt="...">
        <p>
          The applications for artificial intelligence are endless. The technology can be applied to many different sectors and industries.
          AI is being tested and used in the healthcare industry for suggesting drug dosages, identifying treatments, and for aiding in surgical procedures in the operating room.
          Other examples of machines with artificial intelligence include computers that play chess and self-driving cars. 
          Each of these machines must weigh the consequences of any action they take, as each action will impact the end result. 
          In chess, the end result is winning the game. For self-driving cars, the computer system must account for all external data and compute it to act in a way that prevents a collision.<br>
          Artificial intelligence also has applications in the financial industry, where it is used to detect and flag activity in banking and finance such as unusual debit card usage and large account deposits—all of which help a bank's fraud department.
          <br>Applications for AI are also being used to help streamline and make trading easier. This is done by making supply, demand, and pricing of securities easier to estimate.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="carousel-item">
        <img src="slider3.jpg" class="d-block w-100" style="height: 530px; width: 100%" alt="...">
        <p>
          artificial intelligence can be divided into two different categories: 
          weak and strong. Weak artificial intelligence embodies a system designed to carry out one particular job. 
          Weak AI systems include video games such as the chess example from above and personal assistants such as Amazon's Alexa and 
          Apple's Siri. You ask the assistant a question, and it answers it for you.
          <br>Strong artificial intelligence systems are systems that carry on the tasks considered to be human-like. These tend to be more complex and complicated systems. They are programmed to handle situations in which they may be required to problem solve without having a person intervene. These kinds of systems can be found in applications like self-driving cars or in hospital operating rooms.

                                <span class="overlay-text" style="font-weight:200px;"> As the hype around AI has accelerated, 
                                    vendors have been scrambling to promote how their products and services use it. Often, what they refer to as AI is simply a 
                                    component of the technology, such as machine learning. AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing 
                                    and training machine learning algorithms. No single programming language is synonymous with AI, but Python, R, Java, C++ and Julia 
                                    have features popular with AI developers.<br><br>

                                    In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training data, 
                                    analyzing the data for correlations and patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions about future states. 
                                    In this way, a chatbot that is fed examples of text can learn to generate lifelike exchanges with people, or an image recognition tool can learn to identify and describe objects in images by reviewing millions of examples. New, rapidly improving generative AI techniques can create realistic text, images, music and other media.

      <h1> AI description </h1>
      <p>
        AI has become a catchall term for applications that perform complex tasks that once required human input, such as communicating with customers online or playing chess. 
        The term is often used interchangeably with its subfields, which include machine learning (ML) and deep learning.
        There are differences, however. For example, machine learning is focused on building systems that learn or improve their performance based on the data they consume. 
        It’s important to note that although all machine learning is AI, not all AI is machine learning.
        To get the full value from AI, many companies are making significant investments in data science teams. 
        Data science combines statistics, computer science, and business knowledge to extract value from various data sources.
